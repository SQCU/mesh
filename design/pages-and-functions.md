# Pages and functions

The [asynchronous collective contract](async-collectives.md) is the complete scope.
The caller supplies the mesh and tensor placement. Mesh realizes their storage,
indexed dependencies and numerical function bindings before invocation.

Pages back values; they do not define tensor dimensions or numerical call extents.
Configured views name the actual registered storage. Presence denotes available
values, and reader ownership retains their storage through actual use. Transport
completion and numerical availability are different facts.

Functions consume available indexed input regions and publish their output regions
after the corresponding writes are visible. A publication does not finish or pause
the enclosing operation. Other producer work and consumers with available inputs
continue independently. Missing inputs constrain only the work that reads them.

Distinct simultaneously live values have distinct storage. Source storage remains
valid until numerical readers and the transport device finish accessing it. That
lifetime does not impose a dependency on independent production.

The substrate is Thunderbolt SEND/RECV, as specified by Apple TN3205. Mesh binds
send and receive endpoints to registered storage and uses the existing completion
mechanisms. Numerical callers do not implement transport or page-table operations.

Papadopoulos and Culler, *Monsoon: an Explicit Token-Store Architecture* (1990),
supplies operand-associated presence prior art. The JAX authors' Pallas collective
matmul supplies indexed forwarding and distinct live receive buffers. Links are in
the [contract](async-collectives.md#mechanism-sources).
